'''You are interested in creating a program that will solve for the value of a quadratic. 
A quadratic follows the format of AX2 +BX + C (A,B,C are variables) 
Write a small python program that does the following:
1. Ask the user to enter the value of A,B,C and X. 
2. Your program will then calculate the value of the quadratic. 
3. Your program should output the quadratic along with the value of the quadratic.(See sample output). Check your math! 
4. You should test your programs for multiple combinations of positive and negative values of all variables. 
5. Attach screenshots of at least 4 different combinations. 
6. Upload your code to Git Hub.'''
